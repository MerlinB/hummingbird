Hummingbird helps you build real-time Bitcoin applications. Optimizing for speed and stability, Hummingbird handles the lower levels between your app and Bitcoin, ensuring your user experiences are always fast and reliable.


* **Connect directly** to a Bitcoin node for speed
* **Receive application data** back quickly as a peer of your own node
* **Scan mempool for transactions** relevant to your application

Hummingbird takes a novel approach to refreshing the mempool, ensuring all transactions are processed quickly. Due to the way peer to peer Bitcoin works, there are sometimes race conditions when asking for the mempool—Hummingbird ensures all transactions come in safely.

*Note: With Hummingbird, your application logic should be able to handle processing a transaction twice. It doesn't happen often, but sometimes you need to re-process old transactions, and a careful use of database indexes and checking error messages can safely ensure your application works as expected. Check the `helpers` file for examples.*

## Install

    npm install hummingbird-bitcoin

## Documentation

Hummingbird enables application state machines to be called while processing transactions.

```javascript
import Hummingbird from "hummingbird-bitcoin"
import { connect } from "./helpers"

const hummingbird = new Hummingbird({
    rpc: { host: "127.0.0.1", user: "root", pass: "bitcoin" },
    peer: { host: "127.0.0.1" },
    from: 600000,
    state_machines: [
        new ApplicationStateMachine(),
    ],
});

class ApplicationStateMachine {
    async onstart() {
        this.db = await connect();
    }

    async ontransaction(tx) {
        await this.db.collection("transactions").insertOne(tx);
    }

    async onrealtime() {
        console.log("block processing has caught up");
    }

    async reset() {
        // useful for testing
    }
}

hummingbird.start();
```



You can stack as many `state_machines` in a Hummingbird instance as you want, and they'll be processed in order, so they can depend on each other.

`onrealtime` is called every time the crawler catches up with crawling blocks and starts reading from the mempool again. It can be useful to have custom logic in here (like clearing the existing mempool).

`ontransaction` is called for every transaction with [TXO](https://github.com/interplanaria/txo) transaction object.

`ontransactions` can be overridden, which allows custom block processing—useful for processing block transactions in a custom order or performing validation logic.

Hummingbird uses a `tape.txt` file similar to [Neon Planaria](https://neon.planaria.network/) to keep track of processing—you can easily fast forward, rewind or snapshot crawling progress.

```



## Scripts

Hummingbird has a number of useful helpers that can be used in testing or scripts. Here's an example how you might create a "patcher", a script that can process a block at any height in the blockchain:

```javascript
const log = require("debug")("patcher");
import config from "../config";

import { wait } from "../helpers"

import GenesisStateMachine from "../genesis/state_machine"
import PaymentsStateMachine from "../payments/state_machine"
import ProtocolStateMachine from "../protocol/state_machine"

import Hummingbird from "hummingbird"

if (require.main === module) {
    (async function() {
        const heights = process.argv.slice(2).map(Number);
      
        console.log(`started crawling ${heights.length} heights`);

        const hum = new Hummingbird({
            rpc: { host: "127.0.0.1", user: "root", pass: "bitcoin" },
            peer: { host: "127.0.0.1" },
            tapefile: "patching_tape.txt", // provide a different tape
            state_machines: [
                new GenesisStateMachine(),
                new PaymentsStateMachine(),
                new ProtocolStateMachine(),
            ]
        });

      	// override onconnect, instead of starting crawl from tape, crawl using our heights
        hum.onconnect = async function() {
            for (const height of heights) {
                await hum.crawlblock(height);
            }

          	// afterwards disconnect and don't autoreconnect
            hum.reconnect = false;
            await hum.disconnect();
            console.log(`finished crawling ${heights.length} heights`);
            process.exit();
        };

        hum.start();
    })();
}
```
## Modes

For speed and efficiency, Hummingbird can split block and mempool handlers into two separate processes. The mempool listener will wait until the block processer has caught up, and then switch to real-time.

```javascript
// script1.js
const hummingbird = new Hummingbird({
    mode: Hummingbird.MODE.BLOCK,
    ...
});

// script2.js
const hummingbird = new Hummingbird({
    mode: Hummingbird.MODE.MEMPOOL,
    ...
});
```

This is useful to continue processing mempool transactions in real-time during large blocks.
